Unnilbium has been proposed as an alternative name.\",\"Appearance unknown, however it is most likely silvery-white or grey and metallic. Lawrencium is a synthetic rare-earth metal. There are eight known radioisotopes, the most stable being Lr-262 with a half-life of 3.6 hours. Due to the short half-life of lawrencium, and its radioactivity, there are no known uses for it. Identified by Albert Ghiorso in 1961 at Berkeley. It was produced by bombarding californium with boron ions. The name is temporary IUPAC nomenclature, the origin of the name comes from Ernest O. Lawrence, the inventor of the cyclotron. If sufficient amounts of lawrencium were produced, it would pose a radiation hazard.\",\"Radioactive transactinide element. Expected to have similar chemical properties to those displayed by hafnium. Rf-260 was discovered by the Joint Nuclear Research Institute at Dubna (U.S.S.R.) in 1964. Researchers at Berkeley discovered Unq-257 and Unq-258 in 1964.\",\"Also known as Hahnium, Ha. Radioactive transactinide element. Half-life of 1.6s. Discovered in 1970 by Berkeley researchers. So far, seven isotopes have been discovered.\",\"Half-life of 0.9 +/- 0.2 s. Discovered by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna (U.S.S.R.) in June of 1974. Its existence was confirmed by the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and Livermore National Laboratory in September of 1974.\",\"Radioactive transition metal. Half-life of approximately 1/500 s. Discovered by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna (U.S.S.R.) in 1976. Confirmed by West German physicists at the Heavy Ion Research Laboratory at Darmstadt.\",\"Radioactive transition metal first synthesized in 1984 by a German research team led by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Muenzenberg at the Institute for Heavy Ion Research at Darmstadt.\",\"Half-life of approximately 5 ms. The creation of this element demonstrated that fusion techniques could indeed be used to make new, heavy nuclei. Made and identified by physicists of the Heavy Ion Research Laboratory, Darmstadt, West Germany in 1982. Named in honor of Lise Meitner, the Austrian physicist.\",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],\"dipole_polarizability\":[4.50710742367,1.3837467,164.0,37.71,20.53,20.53,7.6,5.24,3.7,2.67,162.7,70.89,46.0,37.31,24.93,24.93,24.93,11.07,290.6,169.0,142.28,114.34,97.34,78.4,66.8,63.93,57.71,51.1,46.5,38.8,49.9,39.43,29.8,26.24,21.8,17.075,318.8,186.0,153.0,121.0,106.0,72.5,80.4,65.0,58.0,32.0,52.5,49.65,68.7,42.4,42.2,37.0,34.6,27.815,401.0,268.0,210.0,200.0,190.0,212.0,212.0,194.0,187.0,159.0,172.0,165.0,159.0,153.0,147.0,140.7,148.0,109.0,88.0,75.0,65.0,57.0,51.0,44.0,36.1,33.91,51.7,47.1,50.0,46.0,43.0,33.18,311.5,242.8,217.0,217.0,171.0,137.0,167.0,165.0,157.0,155.0,153.0,138.0,133.0,161.0,123.0,110.8,\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",27.64,29.9,31.98,\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",46.33],\"electron_affinity\":[0.754195,-19.7,0.618049,-2.4,0.279723,1.262119,-1.4,1.4611135,3.4011897000000006,\"NaN\",0.547926,\"NaN\",0.43283,1.3895211,0.746607,2.07710403,3.612725,-11.5,0.50147,0.02455,0.188,0.079,0.525,0.6659999999999999,\"NaN\",0.151,0.66225646,1.156,1.235,\"NaN\",0.43,1.232712,0.804,2.02067,3.3635882000000006,\"NaN\",0.48591999999999996,0.048,0.307,0.426,0.917406,0.748,0.55,1.05,1.137,0.562,1.3019999999999998,\"NaN\",0.3,1.112067,1.046,1.9708759999999999,3.0590368,-0.055999999999999994,0.47162600000000005,0.14462,0.47,0.65,0.9620000000000001,1.916,\"NaN\",\"NaN\",0.8640000000000001,\"NaN\",1.165,0.35200000000000004,\"NaN\",\"NaN\",1.0290000000000001,-0.02,0.34,0.013999999999999999,0.322,0.81626,0.15,1.1,1.5638,2.128,2.30863,\"NaN\",0.377,0.35674316,0.942362,1.9,2.8,\"NaN\",0.486,0.1,0.35,\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",0.055999999999999994],\"electronic_configuration\":[\"1s\",\"1s2\",\"[He]

Unnilbium has been proposed as an alternative name.\",\"Appearance unknown, however it is most likely silvery-white or grey and metallic. Lawrencium is a synthetic rare-earth metal. There are eight known radioisotopes, the most stable being Lr-262 with a half-life of 3.6 hours. Due to the short half-life of lawrencium, and its radioactivity, there are no known uses for it. Identified by Albert Ghiorso in 1961 at Berkeley. It was produced by bombarding californium with boron ions. The name is temporary IUPAC nomenclature, the origin of the name comes from Ernest O. Lawrence, the inventor of the cyclotron. If sufficient amounts of lawrencium were produced, it would pose a radiation hazard.\",\"Radioactive transactinide element. Expected to have similar chemical properties to those displayed by hafnium. Rf-260 was discovered by the Joint Nuclear Research Institute at Dubna (U.S.S.R.) in 1964. Researchers at Berkeley discovered Unq-257 and Unq-258 in 1964.\",\"Also known as Hahnium, Ha. Radioactive transactinide element. Half-life of 1.6s. Discovered in 1970 by Berkeley researchers. So far, seven isotopes have been discovered.\",\"Half-life of 0.9 +/- 0.2 s. Discovered by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna (U.S.S.R.) in June of 1974. Its existence was confirmed by the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and Livermore National Laboratory in September of 1974.\",\"Radioactive transition metal. Half-life of approximately 1/500 s. Discovered by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna (U.S.S.R.) in 1976. Confirmed by West German physicists at the Heavy Ion Research Laboratory at Darmstadt.\",\"Radioactive transition metal first synthesized in 1984 by a German research team led by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Muenzenberg at the Institute for Heavy Ion Research at Darmstadt.\",\"Half-life of approximately 5 ms. The creation of this element demonstrated that fusion techniques could indeed be used to make new, heavy nuclei. Made and identified by physicists of the Heavy Ion Research Laboratory, Darmstadt, West Germany in 1982. Named in honor of Lise Meitner, the Austrian physicist.\",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],\"dipole_polarizability\":[4.50710742367,1.3837467,164.0,37.71,20.53,20.53,7.6,5.24,3.7,2.67,162.7,70.89,46.0,37.31,24.93,24.93,24.93,11.07,290.6,169.0,142.28,114.34,97.34,78.4,66.8,63.93,57.71,51.1,46.5,38.8,49.9,39.43,29.8,26.24,21.8,17.075,318.8,186.0,153.0,121.0,106.0,72.5,80.4,65.0,58.0,32.0,52.5,49.65,68.7,42.4,42.2,37.0,34.6,27.815,401.0,268.0,210.0,200.0,190.0,212.0,212.0,194.0,187.0,159.0,172.0,165.0,159.0,153.0,147.0,140.7,148.0,109.0,88.0,75.0,65.0,57.0,51.0,44.0,36.1,33.91,51.7,47.1,50.0,46.0,43.0,33.18,311.5,242.8,217.0,217.0,171.0,137.0,167.0,165.0,157.0,155.0,153.0,138.0,133.0,161.0,123.0,110.8,\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",27.64,29.9,31.98,\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",46.33],\"electron_affinity\":[0.754195,-19.7,0.618049,-2.4,0.279723,1.262119,-1.4,1.4611135,3.4011897000000006,\"NaN\",0.547926,\"NaN\",0.43283,1.3895211,0.746607,2.07710403,3.612725,-11.5,0.50147,0.02455,0.188,0.079,0.525,0.6659999999999999,\"NaN\",0.151,0.66225646,1.156,1.235,\"NaN\",0.43,1.232712,0.804,2.02067,3.3635882000000006,\"NaN\",0.48591999999999996,0.048,0.307,0.426,0.917406,0.748,0.55,1.05,1.137,0.562,1.3019999999999998,\"NaN\",0.3,1.112067,1.046,1.9708759999999999,3.0590368,-0.055999999999999994,0.47162600000000005,0.14462,0.47,0.65,0.9620000000000001,1.916,\"NaN\",\"NaN\",0.8640000000000001,\"NaN\",1.165,0.35200000000000004,\"NaN\",\"NaN\",1.0290000000000001,-0.02,0.34,0.013999999999999999,0.322,0.81626,0.15,1.1,1.5638,2.128,2.30863,\"NaN\",0.377,0.35674316,0.942362,1.9,2.8,\"NaN\",0.486,0.1,0.35,\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",\"NaN\",0.055999999999999994],\"electronic_configuration\":[\"1s\",\"1s2\",\"[He]
